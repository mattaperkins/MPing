.SH NAME
mping \- terminal-based ping visualiser with jitter and loss display

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mping
[\fB\-s\fR|\fB\-\-silent\fR]
[\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR]
[\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-version\fR]
\fIhost\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBMPing\fR is a terminal utility that visualises the latency, jitter, and packet loss of ICMP echo requests ("ping") to a target host or IP address. It produces a compact, real-time, horizontally scrolling graph using Unicode block characters, colour-coded by performance level.

MPing runs continuously until interrupted (Ctrl+C).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
Disable the audible terminal bell on successful pings. Bell remains disabled on timeouts.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help and usage information, then exit.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version.

.SH COLOURS
.TP
\fBGreen\fR
Latency below threshold — good performance.
.TP
\fBYellow\fR
Latency exceeds dynamic scale threshold.
.TP
\fBRed\fR
Timeout or unreachable — represents packet loss.

.SH OUTPUT
The graph updates each second with a coloured block character representing the ping result. A summary line includes:

.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\fBLatency\fR (latest round-trip time)
.IP \[bu]
\fBJitter\fR (difference between last two latencies)
.IP \[bu]
\fBLoss\fR (% of timeouts since start)
.RE

Example:

.EX
▁▃▅▅▆▇█▇▇▆▅▃▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ timeout  jitter: 15.2ms  loss: 18%
.EE
